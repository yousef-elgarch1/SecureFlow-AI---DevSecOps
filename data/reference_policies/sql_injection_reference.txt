SECURITY POLICY SP-REF-001: SQL Injection Prevention

1. RISK STATEMENT
SQL injection vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute arbitrary database queries through unsanitized user input, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. This represents a critical risk to data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

2. COMPLIANCE MAPPING
- NIST CSF PR.DS-5: Protections against data leaks are implemented
- NIST CSF PR.AC-4: Access permissions and authorizations are managed
- ISO 27001 A.14.2.5: Secure system engineering principles
- ISO 27001 A.8.22: Segregation in networks
- OWASP Top 10 2021: A03 Injection

3. POLICY REQUIREMENTS
All database interactions must implement the following security controls:
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all SQL operations
- Implement input validation and sanitization for user-supplied data
- Apply principle of least privilege for database account permissions
- Enable database query logging and monitoring

4. REMEDIATION PLAN
Action Required: Replace all string concatenation in SQL queries with parameterized statements
Responsible Party: Development Team Lead
Timeline: 48 hours (Critical severity)
Verification Method: Code review and automated SAST re-scan

5. MONITORING AND DETECTION
- Deploy Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules to detect SQL injection attempts
- Enable real-time alerting for suspicious database query patterns
- Implement database activity monitoring (DAM) solutions
- Conduct quarterly penetration testing focused on injection vulnerabilities

6. SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Zero SQL injection vulnerabilities detected in subsequent security scans
- All database queries use parameterized statements (100% coverage)
- WAF successfully blocks simulated SQL injection attacks
- Database access follows least privilege principle
