This policy is aligned with the following compliance requirements:

* ISO 27001 - A.8.23: Web filtering
* ISO 27001 - A.8.8: Management of technical vulnerabilities
* ISO 27001 - A.5.14: Information transfer
* ISO 27001 - A.6.4: Disciplinary process
* NIST CSF - RC.CO: Recovery activities are communicated to internal and external stakeholders
* CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**POLICY REQUIREMENTS**

To mitigate the risk of cross-site request forgery attacks, the following security controls must be implemented:

1. **Technical Requirements**: Implement a vetted library or framework that prevents CSRF attacks, such as OWASP CSRFGuard.
2. **Procedural Requirements**: Ensure that all web application developers and security personnel are trained on CSRF prevention best practices.
3. **Success Criteria**: Conduct regular code reviews and penetration testing to ensure the absence of CSRF vulnerabilities.
4. **Validation Methods**: Use automated tools, such as OWASP ZAP, to scan for CSRF vulnerabilities.

**REMEDIATION PLAN**

To address this vulnerability, the following technical actions are required:

1. **Responsible Party**: Dev Lead
2. **Timeline**: 2 weeks
3. **Verification Steps**: Code review, re-scan with OWASP ZAP, and penetration testing

**MONITORING AND DETECTION**

To detect similar vulnerabilities in the future, the following strategies will be implemented:

1. **Logging and Alerting**: Configure logging and alerting mechanisms to detect suspicious activity.
2. **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly scan the web application for CSRF vulnerabilities using automated tools.
3. **Code Review**: Conduct regular code reviews to ensure adherence to CSRF prevention best practices.

By implementing this policy, we will ensure the security and integrity of our web application, protect our users' data, and maintain compliance with relevant industry standards and regulations.

POLICY 14: DAST Vulnerability
LLM: LLaMA 3.1 8B Instant
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title: Weak Authentication Method
Severity: MEDIUM

**SP-2024-001: Secure Authentication over Unsecured Connections**

**Risk Statement**

The use of HTTP basic or digest authentication over an unsecured connection poses a medium-risk vulnerability to our organization. If exploited, an attacker could intercept and reuse user credentials, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of our systems and data. This vulnerability affects all users accessing our application via the `http://testapp.local:3000/api/login` endpoint, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, and reputational damage.

**Compliance Mapping**

* NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF):
	+ PR.DS-5: Protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information
	+ ID.AM-1: Identify and manage information system risks
* ISO 27001 Annex A controls:
	+ A.8.5: Secure authentication
	+ A.7.4: Physical security monitoring
	+ A.8.21: Security of network services
	+ A.8.1: User endpoint devices
	+ A.7.14: Secure disposal or re-use of equipment
* Industry standards:
	+ CWE-287: Improper Authentication
	+ OWASP: Authentication and Session Management

**Policy Requirements**

To mitigate this vulnerability, we require the following security controls to be implemented:

1. **Technical Requirements**: Protect the connection using HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or later) or implement a stronger authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or JWT-based authentication.
2. **Procedural Requirements**: Ensure that all authentication requests are made over a secure connection (HTTPS) and that sensitive data is transmitted using encryption.
3. **Success Criteria**: Validate the implementation of HTTPS or a stronger authentication mechanism through code review, re-scan, and penetration testing.
4. **Logging and Alerting**: Implement logging and alerting mechanisms to detect and respond to potential authentication-related incidents.

**Remediation Plan**

* **Responsible Party**: Dev Lead (Medium severity)
* **Timeline**: 2 weeks
* **Technical Actions**:
	1. Update the application to use HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or later) for all authentication requests.
	2. Implement a stronger authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or JWT-based authentication.
* **Verification Steps**:
	1. Code review to ensure HTTPS or stronger authentication mechanism is implemented correctly.
	2. Re-scan the application using a vulnerability scanner to detect any remaining vulnerabilities.
	3. Conduct penetration testing to verify the effectiveness of the implemented security controls.

**Monitoring and Detection**

To detect similar vulnerabilities in the future, we will:

1. **Regularly Review Application Code**: Conduct regular code reviews to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
2. **Implement Logging and Alerting**: Implement logging and alerting mechanisms to detect and respond to potential authentication-related incidents.
3. **Continuously Monitor Application**: Continuously monitor the application for any signs of unauthorized access or data breaches.

By implementing these security controls and procedures, we can mitigate the risk associated with HTTP basic or digest authentication over unsecured connections and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and data.
