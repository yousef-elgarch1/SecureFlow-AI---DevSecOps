    "policy": "## Policy: Explicit Unescape Prevention\n\n### Risk Assessment\n**Severity**: HIGH\n**CWE**: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Attack Vector**: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the user input, which would then be executed by the browser, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or other malicious activities.\n**Business Impact**: A successful attack could result in significant financial losses, reputational damage, and operational disruptions, including but not limited to:\n* Data breaches and theft of sensitive information\n* Unauthorized access to systems and applications\n* Disruption of business operations and services\n* Loss of customer trust and confidence\n* Regulatory fines and penalties\n\n### Technical Remediation\n\n#### Recommended Approach:\nTo prevent explicit unescape vulnerabilities, it is recommended to use a templating engine that automatically escapes user input, such as Handlebars or Mustache with the `escapeHtml` helper. Additionally, input validation and sanitization should be performed on all user input to prevent malicious code injection.\n\n#### Code Example:\n```python\n# Before (Vulnerable)\ntemplate = Template(\"{{name}}\")\nrendered_template = template.render(name=\"<script>alert('XSS')</script>\")\n\n# After (Secure) - Using Handlebars\nfrom handlebars import Handlebars\ntemplate = Handlebars().template(\"{{escapeHtml name}}\")\nrendered_template = template.render(name=\"<script>alert('XSS')</script>\")\n```\n\n#### Alternative Approaches:\n1. **Option 1**: Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to define which sources of content are allowed to be executed within a web page. This can help prevent XSS attacks by restricting the types of scripts that can be executed.\n2. **Option 2**: Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent XSS attacks. A WAF can be configured to inspect incoming traffic and block requests that contain malicious code.\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Update Dependencies**: Update the Handlebars library to the latest version.\n2. **Refactor Code**: Refactor the code to use the `escapeHtml` helper in the templating engine.\n3. **Add Validation**: Add input validation to ensure that user input is sanitized and does not contain malicious code.\n4. **Configure Security Headers**: Configure security headers to prevent XSS attacks, such as the `Content-Security-Policy` header.\n5. **Update Tests**: Update unit tests and integration tests to cover the new security features.\n\n### Code Review Checklist\n\n- [ ] All user input is validated/sanitized\n- [ ] Framework security features are enabled\n- [ ] Unit tests cover security scenarios\n- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets\n- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak sensitive info\n\n### CI/CD Integration\n\n#### SAST Configuration:\n```yaml\nrules:\n  - id: explicit-unescape\n    pattern: \"{{{.*?}}}\"\n    languages:\n      - handlebars\n    severity: HIGH\n    message: \"Explicit unescape detected\"\n```\n\n#### Pre-commit Hook:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\ngit diff --name-only | grep -E \"\\.hbs|\\.handlebars\" | xargs -I {} semgrep --config explicit-unescape.yaml {}\n```\n\n### Compliance Mapping\n\n**NIST Cybersecurity Framework**:\n* PR.DS-5: Data at rest is protected\n* PR.DS-6: Data in transit is protected\n* PR.AT-4: Malicious code is detected\n\n**ISO/IEC 27001:2022**:\n* A.8.23: Web filtering\n* A.8.8: Management of technical vulnerabilities\n* A.8.28: Secure coding\n* A.8.7: Protection against malware\n* A.8.11: Data masking\n\n### Testing Strategy\n\n#### Unit Tests:\n```python\nimport unittest\nfrom handlebars import Handlebars\n\nclass TestExplicitUnescape(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_escape_html(self):\n        template = Handlebars().template(\"{{escapeHtml name}}\")\n        rendered_template = template.render(name=\"<script>alert('XSS')</script>\")\n        self.assertNotIn(\"<script>\", rendered_template)\n```\n\n#### Integration Tests:\nUse a testing framework such as Selenium to test the application's UI and ensure that user input is properly sanitized and escaped.\n\n### Performance Considerations\nThe use of a templating engine and input validation may introduce some performance overhead. However, this is a necessary trade-off to ensure the security of the application.\n\n### Timeline & Priority\n\n**Priority**: HIGH\n**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days\n**Deadline**: 1 week from the date of this policy\n**Assigned To**: Senior Developer\n\n### References\n- OWASP: [OWASP Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)\n- CWE: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html\n- Framework Docs: [Handlebars Documentation](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/)",

This could be done through phishing emails, malicious advertisements, or other social engineering tactics.\n**Business Impact**: A successful CSRF attack could result in significant financial losses, damage to the company's reputation, and potential legal liabilities. It could also lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, disruption of business operations, and loss of customer trust.\n\n### Technical Remediation\n\n#### Recommended Approach:\nThe recommended approach is to use the `csurf` middleware package in Express.js to protect against CSRF attacks. This package generates a token for each user session and verifies it on every request to ensure that the request is legitimate.\n\n#### Code Example:\n```javascript\n// Before (Vulnerable)\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\n// After (Secure) - Using csurf middleware\nconst csurf = require('csurf');\nconst csrfProtection = csurf({ cookie: true });\n\napp.use(csrfProtection);\n\napp.get('/form', (req, res) => {\n  res.render('form', { csrfToken: req.csrfToken() });\n});\n\napp.post('/submit', (req, res) => {\n  // Submit logic here\n});\n```\n\n#### Alternative Approaches:\n1. **Option 1**: Use a different CSRF protection library, such as `express-csrf`. This library provides similar functionality to `csurf` but has some additional features, such as support for JSON Web Tokens (JWT).\n2. **Option 2**: Implement a custom CSRF protection solution using a token-based approach. This would involve generating a token for each user session and verifying it on every request. However, this approach is not recommended as it can be error-prone and may not provide the same level of security as a well-tested library like `csurf`.\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Update Dependencies**: Install the `csurf` package using npm or yarn: `npm install csurf` or `yarn add csurf`.\n2. **Refactor Code**: Update the Express.js application to use the `csurf` middleware.\n3. **Add Validation**: Ensure that all forms and requests include the CSRF token and that it is validated on every request.\n4. **Configure Security Headers**: Configure security headers to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n5. **Update Tests**: Update unit tests and integration tests to cover the new CSRF protection functionality.\n\n### Code Review Checklist\n\n- [ ] All user input is validated/sanitized\n- [ ] Framework security features are enabled\n- [ ] Unit tests cover security scenarios\n- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets\n- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak sensitive info\n- [ ] CSRF token is included in all forms and requests\n- [ ] CSRF token is validated on every request\n\n### CI/CD Integration\n\n#### SAST Configuration:\n```yaml\nrules:\n  - id: csrf-protection\n    pattern: '$.csrfProtection'\n    message: 'CSRF protection is not enabled'\n```\n\n#### Pre-commit Hook:\n```bash\n#!/bin/sh\nnpm run lint\nnpm run test\n```\n\n### Compliance Mapping\n\n**NIST Cybersecurity Framework**:\n* RC.CO - 3: Recovery activities are communicated to internal and external stakeholders (ensure that incident response plans include procedures for responding to CSRF attacks)\n\n**ISO/IEC 27001:2022**:\n* A.8.23: Web filtering (ensure that web filtering is implemented to prevent malicious content)\n* A.8.26: Application security requirements (ensure that application security requirements include CSRF protection)\n* A.8.29: Security testing in development and acceptance (ensure that security testing includes testing for CSRF vulnerabilities)\n* A.8.8: Management of technical vulnerabilities (ensure that technical vulnerabilities, including CSRF vulnerabilities, are identified and addressed)\n\n### Testing Strategy\n\n#### Unit Tests:\n```javascript\nconst request = require('supertest');\nconst app = require('./app');\n\ndescribe('CSRF protection', () => {\n  it('should include CSRF token in form', (done) => {\n    request(app)\n      .get('/form')\n      .expect(200)\n      .expect((res) => {\n        expect(res.body.csrfToken).not.toBeUndefined();\n      })\n      .end(done);\n  });\n\n  it('should validate CSRF token on submit', (done) => {\n    request(app)\n      .post('/submit')\n      .expect(403)\n      .end(done);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n#### Integration Tests:\nUse a tool like Selenium or Cypress to test the application's CSRF protection.\n\n### Performance Considerations\nThe `csurf` middleware may introduce some additional overhead due to the generation and verification of CSRF tokens.

The attack vector involves manipulating the SQL query to execute unintended actions, such as extracting sensitive data or escalating privileges.\n**Business Impact**: A successful SQL injection attack could result in significant financial losses, reputational damage, and operational disruptions. The organization may face legal and regulatory consequences, loss of customer trust, and potential intellectual property theft.\n\n### Technical Remediation\n\n#### Recommended Approach:\nThe recommended approach is to use parameterized queries or prepared statements with the `pg` module in Node.js. This approach separates the SQL code from the user input, preventing an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code.\n\n#### Code Example:\n```javascript\n// Before (Vulnerable)\nconst { Pool } = require('pg');\nconst pool = new Pool({\n  user: 'username',\n  host: 'localhost',\n  database: 'database',\n  password: 'password',\n  port: 5432,\n});\nconst userInput = req.body.username;\nconst query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${userInput}'`;\npool.query(query, (err, res) => {\n  if (err) {\n    console.error(err);\n  } else {\n    console.log(res.rows);\n  }\n});\n\n// After (Secure) - Using pg module\nconst { Pool } = require('pg');\nconst pool = new Pool({\n  user: 'username',\n  host: 'localhost',\n  database: 'database',\n  password: 'password',\n  port: 5432,\n});\nconst userInput = req.body.username;\nconst query = {\n  text: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = $1`,\n  values: [userInput],\n};\npool.query(query, (err, res) => {\n  if (err) {\n    console.error(err);\n  } else {\n    console.log(res.rows);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Alternative Approaches:\n1. **Option 1**: Using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library like Sequelize, which provides a higher-level abstraction and automatic protection against SQL injection attacks.\n2. **Option 2**: Implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent SQL injection attacks, although this approach should be used in conjunction with proper coding practices.\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Update Dependencies**: Ensure the `pg` module is updated to the latest version.\n2. **Refactor Code**: Replace all instances of string concatenation in SQL queries with parameterized queries or prepared statements.\n3. **Add Validation**: Validate all user input to prevent malicious data from being injected into SQL queries.\n4. **Configure Security Headers**: Configure security headers to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n5. **Update Tests**: Update unit tests and integration tests to cover security scenarios and ensure the application is secure.\n\n### Code Review Checklist\n\n- [ ] All user input is validated/sanitized\n- [ ] Framework security features are enabled\n- [ ] Unit tests cover security scenarios\n- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets\n- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak sensitive info\n\n### CI/CD Integration\n\n#### SAST Configuration:\n```yaml\nrules:\n  - id: sql-injection\n    pattern: \"SELECT .*?

For example, an attacker could input `../../../etc/passwd` to access the system's password file.\n**Business Impact**: A successful attack could result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, potentially leading to financial loss, reputational damage, and operational disruption.\n\n### Technical Remediation\n\n#### Recommended Approach:\nTo prevent path traversal attacks, it is recommended to use a whitelisting approach, where only authorized directories and files are allowed to be accessed. This can be achieved by using a library such as `path.join()` and `path.normalize()` to normalize the input path, and then checking if the normalized path is within the allowed directory structure.\n\n#### Code Example:\n```javascript\n// Before (Vulnerable)\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\napp.get('/contributions/:filename', (req, res) => {\n  const filename = req.params.filename;\n  const filePath = './contributions/' + filename;\n  res.sendFile(filePath);\n});\n\n// After (Secure) - Using Node.js path module\nconst express = require('express');\nconst path = require('path');\nconst app = express();\napp.get('/contributions/:filename', (req, res) => {\n  const filename = req.params.filename;\n  const contributionsDir = path.join(__dirname, 'contributions');\n  const filePath = path.join(contributionsDir, filename);\n  const normalizedPath = path.normalize(filePath);\n  if (normalizedPath.startsWith(contributionsDir)) {\n    res.sendFile(normalizedPath);\n  } else {\n    res.status(403).send('Forbidden');\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Alternative Approaches:\n1. **Option 1**: Using a library such as `express-validator` to validate and sanitize user input. This approach provides an additional layer of protection but may not be as effective as the recommended approach.\n2. **Option 2**: Using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent path traversal attacks. This approach provides an additional layer of protection but may not be as effective as the recommended approach and may require additional configuration and maintenance.\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Update Dependencies**: Update the `express` and `path` modules to the latest versions.\n2. **Refactor Code**: Refactor the code to use the `path.join()` and `path.normalize()` functions to normalize the input path.\n3. **Add Validation**: Add validation to check if the normalized path is within the allowed directory structure.\n4. **Configure Security Headers**: Configure security headers to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n5. **Update Tests**: Update unit tests and integration tests to cover the new security feature.\n\n### Code Review Checklist\n\n- [ ] All user input is validated/sanitized\n- [ ] Framework security features are enabled\n- [ ] Unit tests cover security scenarios\n- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets\n- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak sensitive info\n\n### CI/CD Integration\n\n#### SAST Configuration:\n```yaml\nrules:\n  - id: path-traversal\n    pattern: |\n      $REQ.params.filename\n    languages:\n      - javascript\n    severity: HIGH\n```\n\n#### Pre-commit Hook:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\ngit diff --cached --name-only | grep -E '\\.js$' | xargs eslint --rule 'path-traversal: error'\n```\n\n### Compliance Mapping\n\n**NIST Cybersecurity Framework**:\n* PR.DS-5: Data at rest is protected\n* PR.DS-6: Data in transit is protected\n* PR.PT-3: Access to systems and assets is controlled\n\n**ISO/IEC 27001:2022**:\n* A.8.29: Security testing in development and acceptance\n* A.7.2: Physical entry\n* A.8.8: Management of technical vulnerabilities\n* A.7.1: Physical security perimeters\n* A.8.31: Separation of development, test and production environments\n\n### Testing Strategy\n\n#### Unit Tests:\n```javascript\nconst request = require('supertest');\nconst app = require('./app');\n\ndescribe('GET /contributions/:filename', () => {\n  it('should return 200 for valid filename', async () => {\n    const response = await request(app).get('/contributions/valid-filename.txt');\n    expect(response.status).toBe(200);\n  });\n\n  it('should return 403 for invalid filename', async () => {\n    const response = await request(app).get('/contributions/../../../etc/passwd');\n    expect(response.status).toBe(403);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n#### Integration Tests:\nUse a testing framework such as Jest or Mocha to test the security feature in an integrated environment.\n\n### Performance Considerations\nThe recommended approach may have a slight performance impact due to the additional validation and normalization steps. However, this impact is expected to be minimal and can be mitigated by using caching mechanisms or optimizing the code.\n\n### Timeline & Priority\n\n**Priority**: HIGH\n**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days\n**Deadline**: 1 week from the date of this policy\n**Assigned To**: Senior Developer\n\n### References\n- OWASP: [OWASP Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal)\n- CWE: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html\n- Framework Docs: [Node.js path module](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html)",

mode=block\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nReferrer-Policy: same-origin\n```\n\n#### Implementation Example:\n```javascript\n// Express.js example\nconst express = require('express');\nconst helmet = require('helmet');\nconst csrf = require('csurf');\n\nconst app = express();\nconst csrfProtection = csrf({ cookie: true });\n\napp.use(express.json({ limit: '10mb' }));\napp.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true, limit: '10mb' }));\napp.use(helmet());\napp.use(csrfProtection);\n\napp.get('/search', (req, res) => {\n  // Securely render search results\n  res.render('search', { csrfToken: req.csrfToken() });\n});\n```\n\n### WAF Rule Configuration:\n```xml\n<!-- ModSecurity example -->\n<Rule id=\"100000\" patternType=\"OWASP\">\n  <RuleMatch>\n
