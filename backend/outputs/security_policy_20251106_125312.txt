This policy aims to mitigate the risk of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, which can compromise the security of our web application and lead to unauthorized actions. If exploited, a CSRF attack can result in data tampering, unauthorized account modifications, or even financial losses. The affected systems, data, and users include our web application, customer accounts, and sensitive business information.

**Compliance Mapping**

* NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF):
	+ PR.DS-5: Implement secure coding practices
	+ PR.DS-6: Implement secure software development practices
* ISO 27001 Annex A controls:
	+ A.8.23: Web filtering
	+ A.8.8: Management of technical vulnerabilities
	+ A.5.14: Information transfer
	+ A.6.4: Disciplinary process
* Industry standards:
	+ CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
	+ OWASP: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Policy Requirements**

To protect against CSRF attacks, the following security controls must be implemented:

1. **Technical Requirements**:
	* Use a vetted library or framework that provides anti-CSRF tokens, such as OWASP CSRFGuard.
	* Ensure that the application is free of cross-site scripting (XSS) issues, as most CSRF defenses can be bypassed using attacker-controlled script.
2. **Procedural Requirements**:
	* Conduct regular code reviews to identify and address potential CSRF vulnerabilities.
	* Implement secure software development practices, including secure coding guidelines and secure coding training for developers.
3. **Success Criteria and Validation Methods**:
	* Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability scanning to identify potential CSRF vulnerabilities.
	* Review code changes and implement secure coding practices to prevent CSRF attacks.

**Remediation Plan**

To address this vulnerability, the following technical actions must be taken:

1. **Responsible Party**: Development Lead
2. **Timeline**: 2 weeks
3. **Technical Actions**:
	* Implement OWASP CSRFGuard in the web application.
	* Conduct a code review to identify and address potential CSRF vulnerabilities.
	* Update secure coding guidelines and provide secure coding training for developers.
4. **Verification Steps**:
	* Conduct a penetration test to verify the effectiveness of the implemented controls.
	* Review code changes and implement secure coding practices to prevent CSRF attacks.

**Monitoring and Detection**

To detect similar vulnerabilities in the future, the following monitoring and detection strategies must be implemented:

1. **Logging and Alerting Requirements**:
	* Configure logging to capture potential CSRF attacks.
	* Set up alerts to notify security teams of potential CSRF attacks.
2. **Continuous Monitoring Strategies**:
	* Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability scanning to identify potential CSRF vulnerabilities.
	* Review code changes and implement secure coding practices to prevent CSRF attacks.

By implementing these security controls and monitoring strategies, we can effectively mitigate the risk of CSRF attacks and protect our web application, customer accounts, and sensitive business information.

POLICY 14: DAST Vulnerability
LLM: LLaMA 3.1 8B Instant
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title: Weak Authentication Method
Severity: MEDIUM

**Security Policy Section: SP-2023-001 - Secure Authentication over Unsecured Connections**

**Policy Identifier:** SP-2023-001

**Policy Title:** Secure Authentication over Unsecured Connections

**Risk Statement:**

The use of HTTP basic or digest authentication over an unsecured connection poses a medium-severity risk to the organization. If exploited, an attacker can intercept and reuse user credentials, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information. This vulnerability affects all users accessing the application via the affected endpoint, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems.

**Compliance Mapping:**

* NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF):
	+ PR.DS-5: Protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information
	+ ID.RA-5: Implement secure authentication and session management
* ISO 27001 Annex A controls:
	+ A.8.5: Secure authentication
	+ A.7.4: Physical security monitoring
	+ A.8.21: Security of network services
	+ A.8.1: User endpoint devices
	+ A.7.14: Secure disposal or re-use of equipment
* Industry standards:
	+ CWE-287: Improper Authentication
	+ OWASP Top 10: Authentication and Authorization

**Policy Requirements:**

To mitigate this vulnerability, the following security controls must be implemented:

1. **Technical Requirements:**
	* Protect the connection using HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or later) for all authentication requests.
	* Use a stronger authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or JWT, for all API requests.
2. **Procedural Requirements:**
	* Conduct regular code reviews to ensure secure authentication practices.
	* Implement logging and alerting mechanisms to detect potential authentication-related issues.
3. **Success Criteria:**
	* All authentication requests are encrypted using HTTPS.
	* The application uses a stronger authentication mechanism for all API requests.
	* Regular code reviews and logging/alerting mechanisms are in place.

**Remediation Plan:**

* **Responsible Party:** Dev Lead (Medium severity)
* **Timeline:** 2 weeks
* **Technical Actions:**
	+ Update the application to use HTTPS for all authentication requests.
	+ Implement a stronger authentication mechanism for all API requests.
* **Verification Steps:**
	+ Conduct a code review to ensure secure authentication practices.
	+ Perform a re-scan of the application using a vulnerability scanner to verify the fix.

**Monitoring and Detection:**

To detect similar vulnerabilities in the future:

1. **Logging and Alerting:** Implement logging and alerting mechanisms to detect potential authentication-related issues.
2. **Continuous Monitoring:** Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
3. **Code Reviews:** Conduct regular code reviews to ensure secure authentication practices.

By implementing these security controls and procedures, we can mitigate the risk of authentication-related vulnerabilities and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information.

**SP-2023-001: Secure Cookie Flag Policy**

**Policy Title:** Secure Cookie Flag Implementation

**Risk Statement:**

This policy addresses the risk of sensitive information exposure due to the insecure transmission of cookies. The absence of the secure flag in cookies allows unauthorized parties to access sensitive data, potentially leading to identity theft, unauthorized access, or data breaches. If exploited, this vulnerability can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information stored in cookies. Affected systems, data, and users include all web applications and users who interact with them.
