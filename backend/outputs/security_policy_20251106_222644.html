If exploited, a CSRF attack can lead to unauthorized changes to user profiles, financial transactions, or other sensitive operations. This vulnerability affects our web application's API, specifically the `/api/profile/update` endpoint, which is accessible to all users.

**COMPLIANCE MAPPING**

- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF): PR.DS-5 (Protecting Data at Rest)
- ISO 27001 Annex A controls: A.8.23 (Web filtering), A.8.8 (Management of technical vulnerabilities), A.5.14 (Information transfer), and A.6.4 (Disciplinary process)
- Industry standards: OWASP (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)), CWE ( CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF))

**POLICY REQUIREMENTS**

To mitigate the risk of CSRF attacks, we require the following security controls:

1. **Implementation of Anti-CSRF Tokens**: Our web application must use a vetted library or framework that provides anti-CSRF tokens, such as OWASP CSRFGuard.
2. **Proper HTML Form Handling**: All HTML forms must include anti-CSRF tokens to prevent CSRF attacks.
3. **Regular Code Reviews**: Our development team must conduct regular code reviews to ensure that our application is free of cross-site scripting issues, which can bypass CSRF defenses.
4. **Logging and Alerting**: Our logging and alerting systems must detect and alert on suspicious activity related to CSRF attacks.

**Success Criteria**:

- The web application's API has implemented anti-CSRF tokens.
- All HTML forms include anti-CSRF tokens.
- The development team has conducted regular code reviews to ensure CSRF defenses are in place.

**REMEDIATION PLAN**

To address this vulnerability, we require the following technical actions:

- **Responsible Party**: Dev Lead
- **Timeline**: 2 weeks
- **Technical Actions**:
 1. Implement OWASP CSRFGuard in our web application.
 2. Update all HTML forms to include anti-CSRF tokens.
 3. Conduct regular code reviews to ensure CSRF defenses are in place.
- **Verification Steps**:
 1. Code review to ensure anti-CSRF tokens are implemented correctly.
 2. Re-scan the web application for CSRF vulnerabilities.
 3. Conduct penetration testing to verify CSRF defenses.

**MONITORING AND DETECTION**

To detect similar vulnerabilities in the future, we require:

- **Logging and Alerting**: Our logging and alerting systems must detect and alert on suspicious activity related to CSRF attacks.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Our security team must conduct regular security assessments to identify and address potential CSRF vulnerabilities.
- **Code Reviews**: Our development team must conduct regular code reviews to ensure CSRF defenses are in place.

By implementing this policy, we can mitigate the risk of CSRF attacks and protect our web application's security and user data.</div>

**Policy Title:** Secure Authentication over Unsecured Connections

**Risk Statement:**

The use of HTTP basic or digest authentication over an unsecured connection poses a medium-severity risk to the organization. If exploited, this vulnerability could allow unauthorized access to sensitive information, leading to potential data breaches and reputational damage. The affected systems, data, and users include:

* All users accessing the application via the affected API endpoint
* Sensitive information stored on user endpoint devices
* Network services and premises used to access the application

**Compliance Mapping:**

* NIST CSF: PR.DS-5 (Protect Data in Transit)
* ISO 27001: A.8.5 (Secure authentication), A.7.4 (Physical security monitoring), A.8.21 (Security of network services), A.8.1 (User endpoint devices), A.7.14 (Secure disposal or re-use of equipment)
* Industry standards: CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), OWASP (Authentication and Session Management)

**Policy Requirements:**

To mitigate this vulnerability, the following security controls must be implemented:

1. **Technical Requirements:**
	* Protect the connection using HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or later)
	* Implement a stronger authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or JWT
2. **Procedural Requirements:**
	* Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability scans to detect similar vulnerabilities
	* Implement logging and alerting mechanisms to detect unauthorized access attempts
	* Continuously monitor network services and premises for unauthorized physical access
3. **Success Criteria:**
	* HTTPS connection established on the affected API endpoint
	* Stronger authentication mechanism implemented and tested
	* Regular security audits and vulnerability scans conducted
	* Logging and alerting mechanisms implemented and tested

**Remediation Plan:**

* **Responsible Party:** Dev Lead
* **Timeline:** 2 weeks
* **Technical Actions:**
	+ Update the API endpoint to use HTTPS
	+ Implement a stronger authentication mechanism
	+ Conduct code review and re-scan to ensure vulnerability is resolved
* **Verification Steps:**
	+ Conduct penetration testing to verify vulnerability is resolved
	+ Review logging and alerting mechanisms to ensure they are functioning correctly

**Monitoring and Detection:**

To detect similar vulnerabilities in the future, the following strategies will be implemented:
