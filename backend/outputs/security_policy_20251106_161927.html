SP-2024-001: Path Traversal Protection Policy

## RISK STATEMENT
The Path Traversal vulnerability poses a significant risk to our organization's data security. If exploited, an attacker could access sensitive files outside the intended directory, potentially leading to data breaches, intellectual property theft, or disruption of critical business operations. This vulnerability affects our web application, specifically the file handling functionality, and could impact all users and data stored within the application.

## COMPLIANCE MAPPING
This policy aligns with the following compliance requirements:
- NIST CSF: PR.DS-5 (Data Protection), DE.CM-1 (Anomaly Detection)
- ISO 27001 Annex A controls: A.7.1 (Physical security perimeters), A.8.28 (Secure coding), A.8.29 (Security testing in development and acceptance), A.7.2 (Physical entry), A.8.31 (Separation of development, test and production environments)
- Industry standards: OWASP A5:2021 (Security Misconfiguration), CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory)

## POLICY REQUIREMENTS

**Risk Statement:**

The use of HTTP basic or digest authentication over an unsecured connection poses a significant risk to the organization's sensitive data and user credentials. If exploited, this vulnerability could allow unauthorized access to our systems, leading to potential data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage. The affected systems, data, and users include all employees, contractors, and customers who use our web application for authentication purposes.

**Compliance Mapping:**

* NIST CSF: PR.DS-5 (Protect Information and Systems)
* ISO 27001: A.8.5 (Secure authentication), A.7.4 (Physical security monitoring), A.8.21 (Security of network services), A.8.1 (User endpoint devices), A.7.14 (Secure disposal or re-use of equipment)
* CWE: CWE-287 (Improper Authentication)
* OWASP: A9 (Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities)

**Policy Requirements:**

To mitigate this vulnerability, we require the following security controls to be implemented:

1. **Technical Requirements:**
	* Protect the connection using HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or later) for all authentication requests.
	* Implement a stronger authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or JWT, for all web application authentication.
2. **Procedural Requirements:**
	* Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability scans to identify and remediate similar vulnerabilities.
	* Develop and enforce a secure coding standard for all web application development.
	* Provide regular security awareness training to all employees and contractors.

**Success Criteria and Validation Methods:**

* The web application uses HTTPS for all authentication requests.
* A stronger authentication mechanism is implemented for all web application authentication.
* Regular security audits and vulnerability scans are conducted to identify and remediate similar vulnerabilities.
* Secure coding standards are enforced for all web application development.

**Remediation Plan:**

* **Technical Actions:**
	+ Update the web application to use HTTPS for all authentication requests.
	+ Implement a stronger authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or JWT.
* **Responsible Party:** Dev Lead
* **Timeline:** 2 weeks
* **Verification Steps:**
	+ Conduct a code review to ensure HTTPS is implemented correctly.
	+ Perform a vulnerability scan to verify the absence of similar vulnerabilities.

**Monitoring and Detection:**

* Regular security audits and vulnerability scans will be conducted to detect similar vulnerabilities in the future.
* Logging and alerting requirements will be implemented to detect and respond to potential security incidents.
* Continuous monitoring strategies will be implemented to ensure the security controls are effective and up-to-date.</div>
