**Policy Requirements:**

To mitigate the risk of CSRF attacks, the following security controls must be implemented:

1. **Technical Requirements:**
	* Implement Anti-CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations in web applications.
	* Use a secure token generation mechanism (e.g., cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator).
	* Validate tokens on server-side to prevent token tampering.
2. **Procedural Requirements:**
	* Develop and maintain a secure coding standard for web application development.
	* Conduct regular code reviews to ensure adherence to the secure coding standard.
	* Provide training to developers on secure coding practices and CSRF prevention.

**Success Criteria:**

* All web applications with state-changing operations implement Anti-CSRF tokens.
* Secure coding standard is developed and maintained.

**Remediation Plan:**

* **Responsible Party:** Dev Lead
* **Timeline:** 2 weeks
* **Technical Actions:**
	+ Implement Anti-CSRF tokens in affected web applications.
	+ Update secure coding standard to include CSRF prevention guidelines.
	+ Conduct code reviews to ensure adherence to the updated secure coding standard.
* **Verification Steps:**
	+ Code review to ensure Anti-CSRF tokens are implemented correctly.
	+ Re-scan web applications for CSRF vulnerabilities after remediation.

**Monitoring and Detection:**

* Regularly scan web applications for CSRF vulnerabilities using automated tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP).
* Implement logging and alerting mechanisms to detect potential CSRF attacks.
* Conduct continuous monitoring of web application logs to identify potential security incidents.

By implementing this policy, the organization will mitigate the risk of CSRF attacks and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data.

Title: Cross-Domain Misconfiguration
Severity: MEDIUM

**SP-2023-001: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Misconfiguration Policy**

**RISK STATEMENT**

The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration on our web server may allow unauthorized access to sensitive data, potentially leading to data breaches and reputational damage. If exploited, this vulnerability could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our user data, exposing sensitive information to unauthorized parties. This vulnerability affects our web application, specifically the `/api/users` endpoint, and may impact our users' trust and loyalty.

**COMPLIANCE MAPPING**

This policy aligns with the following compliance requirements:

* ISO 27001: A.8.23 (Web filtering), A.8.1 (User endpoint devices), A.8.6 (Capacity management), A.8.3 (Information access restriction), and A.8.16 (Monitoring activities)
* NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF): PR.DS-5 (Protect Data)
* CWE: CWE-264 (Cross-Site Scripting (XSS))
* OWASP: A3:2013 (Broken Access Control)

**POLICY REQUIREMENTS**

To mitigate this vulnerability, we will implement the following security controls:

1. **Configure CORS headers properly**: Ensure that sensitive data is not available in an unauthenticated manner by implementing CORS headers that restrict access to authorized domains.
2. **Implement web application firewall (WAF) rules**: Configure WAF rules to detect and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
3. **Regularly review and update CORS configurations**: Schedule regular reviews of CORS configurations to ensure they remain secure and up-to-date.

Success criteria:

* CORS headers are properly configured to restrict access to authorized domains.
* WAF rules are implemented and regularly reviewed to detect and prevent unauthorized access.
* Regular reviews of CORS configurations are conducted to ensure security and compliance.

**REMEDIATION PLAN**

To remediate this vulnerability, we will:

1. **Configure CORS headers**: Implement CORS headers to restrict access to authorized domains. (Responsible party: Dev Lead, Timeline: 2 weeks)
2. **Implement WAF rules**: Configure WAF rules to detect and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. (Responsible party: Dev Lead, Timeline: 2 weeks)
3. **Review and update CORS configurations**: Schedule regular reviews of CORS configurations to ensure they remain secure and up-to-date. (Responsible party: Dev Lead, Timeline: Ongoing)

**MONITORING AND DETECTION**

To detect similar vulnerabilities in the future, we will:

1. **Regularly scan for vulnerabilities**: Schedule regular vulnerability scans to detect potential security issues.
2. **Implement logging and alerting**: Configure logging and alerting mechanisms to detect and respond to potential security incidents.
3. **Conduct continuous monitoring**: Conduct continuous monitoring of our web application to detect and respond to potential security incidents.

By implementing these security controls and monitoring strategies, we can mitigate the risk of this vulnerability and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our user data.
