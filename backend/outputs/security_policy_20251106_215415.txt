POLICY 14: DAST Vulnerability
LLM: LLaMA 3.1 8B Instant
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title: Weak Authentication Method
Severity: MEDIUM

**SP-2023-001: Secure Authentication over Unsecured Connections**

**Risk Statement:**

The use of HTTP basic or digest authentication over an unsecured connection poses a medium-severity risk to our organization. If exploited, an unauthorized party could intercept and reuse user credentials, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of our systems and data. This vulnerability affects our web application's login functionality, potentially impacting all users who access the system through the affected endpoint.

**Compliance Mapping:**

* NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF):
	+ PR.DS-5: Implement secure protocols for authentication and key exchange
	+ PR.DS-6: Implement secure protocols for data transmission
* ISO 27001 Annex A controls:
	+ A.8.5: Secure authentication
	+ A.8.21: Security of network services
	+ A.8.1: User endpoint devices
	+ A.7.14: Secure disposal or re-use of equipment
* Industry standards:
	+ CWE-287: Improper Authentication
	+ OWASP: Authentication and Session Management

**Policy Requirements:**

To mitigate this vulnerability, we require the following security controls to be implemented:

1. **Technical Requirements:**
	* Update the login endpoint to use HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or later) for all connections.
	* Implement a stronger authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or JWT-based authentication.
2. **Procedural Requirements:**
	* Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
	* Develop and maintain a secure coding standard for all development teams.
3. **Success Criteria:**
	* The login endpoint is updated to use HTTPS within 2 weeks.
	* A stronger authentication mechanism is implemented within 4 weeks.
	* Regular security audits are conducted quarterly.

**Remediation Plan:**

* **Responsible Party:** Development Lead
* **Timeline:** 2 weeks
* **Technical Actions:**
	+ Update the login endpoint to use HTTPS.
	+ Implement a stronger authentication mechanism.
* **Verification Steps:**
	+ Code review by the development team.
	+ Re-scan the application using a web application scanner (e.g., OWASP ZAP).
	+ Conduct a penetration test to verify the effectiveness of the remediation.

**Monitoring and Detection:**

To detect similar vulnerabilities in the future, we will:

1. **Implement Logging and Alerting:**
	* Configure the web application firewall (WAF) to log and alert on potential authentication-related attacks.
	* Implement a security information and event management (SIEM) system to monitor and alert on suspicious activity.
2. **Conduct Continuous Monitoring:**
	* Regularly scan the application for vulnerabilities using a web application scanner.
	* Conduct penetration tests to verify the effectiveness of our security controls.
	* Review and update our secure coding standard regularly.

POLICY 15: DAST Vulnerability
LLM: LLaMA 3.1 8B Instant
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title: Cookie Without Secure Flag
Severity: MEDIUM

**Security Policy Section: SP-2023-001 - Secure Cookie Flag**

**Policy Identifier:** SP-2023-001

**Policy Title:** Secure Cookie Flag Policy

**Risk Statement:**

The Secure Cookie Flag policy aims to mitigate the risk of sensitive information exposure due to insecure cookie transmission. If exploited, this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to user sessions, compromising confidentiality and integrity. Potential consequences include:

* Unauthorized access to sensitive data
* Compromised user sessions
* Reputation damage due to data breaches

Affected systems/data/users:

* All web applications using cookies for session management
* Users with sensitive information stored in cookies

**Compliance Mapping:**

* NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF):
	+ PR.DS-5: Protect data in use
	+ PR.DS-6: Protect data in transit
* ISO 27001 Annex A controls:
	+ A.8.5: Secure authentication
	+ A.8.21: Security of network services
	+ A.8.27: Secure system architecture and engineering principles
	+ A.8.28: Secure coding
	+ A.8.1: User endpoint devices
* Industry standards:
	+ CWE-614: Information Exposure Through an Insecure Protocol

**Policy Requirements:**

To ensure secure cookie transmission, the following requirements must be implemented:

1. **Technical Requirements:**
	* Set the secure flag for cookies containing sensitive information or session tokens.
	* Ensure that cookies are transmitted over encrypted channels (HTTPS).
2. **Procedural Requirements:**
	* Review and update cookie-related code to ensure secure flag is set.
	* Conduct regular security audits to detect similar vulnerabilities.
