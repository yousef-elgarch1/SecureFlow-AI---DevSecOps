                <div class="policy-content">**SP-2023-001: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention Policy**

**Policy Identifier:** SP-2023-001

**Policy Title:** CSRF Prevention Policy

**Risk Statement:**

The absence of Anti-CSRF tokens in HTML submission forms poses a medium-severity risk to our organization. If exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on our application, potentially leading to data tampering, account takeovers, or other malicious activities. This vulnerability affects our web application's security, specifically the `/api/profile/update` endpoint, and could impact our users' sensitive information.

**Compliance Mapping:**

* NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF):
	+ PR.DS-5: Implement secure coding practices to prevent common web application vulnerabilities.
	+ RC.CO: Communicate recovery activities to internal and external stakeholders.
* ISO 27001 Annex A controls:
	+ A.8.23: Web filtering to manage access to external websites and reduce exposure to malicious content.
	+ A.8.8: Management of technical vulnerabilities to obtain, evaluate, and address vulnerabilities.
	+ A.5.14: Information transfer to establish secure rules and procedures for transferring information.
	+ A.6.4: Disciplinary process to formalize and communicate actions against personnel for information security policy violations.
* Industry standards:
	+ OWASP: CSRF is a common web application vulnerability.
	+ CWE: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery.

**Policy Requirements:**

To prevent CSRF attacks, we require the following security controls to be implemented:

1. **Technical Requirements:**
	* Use a vetted library or framework that provides anti-CSRF tokens, such as OWASP CSRFGuard.
	* Ensure the application is free of cross-site scripting (XSS) issues, as most CSRF defenses can be bypassed using attacker-controlled script.
2. **Procedural Requirements:**
	* Conduct regular code reviews to identify and address potential CSRF vulnerabilities.
	* Implement logging and alerting mechanisms to detect and respond to potential CSRF attacks.
3. **Success Criteria:**
	* The application's `/api/profile/update` endpoint is protected with anti-CSRF tokens.
	* Regular code reviews and security testing identify and address potential CSRF vulnerabilities.
	* Logging and alerting mechanisms detect and respond to potential CSRF attacks.

**Remediation Plan:**

To address this vulnerability, we require the following technical actions:

1. **Responsible Party:** Dev Lead
2. **Timeline:** 2 weeks
3. **Technical Actions:**
	* Integrate OWASP CSRFGuard into the application.
	* Conduct a thorough code review to identify and address potential CSRF vulnerabilities.
	* Implement logging and alerting mechanisms to detect and respond to potential CSRF attacks.
4. **Verification Steps:**
	* Conduct a code review to ensure anti-CSRF tokens are properly implemented.
	* Perform a re-scan using a vulnerability scanner to verify the fix.
	* Conduct a penetration test to simulate a CSRF attack and verify the application's defenses.

**Monitoring and Detection:**

To detect similar vulnerabilities in the future, we will:

1. **Regularly Scan for Vulnerabilities:** Use a vulnerability scanner to identify potential CSRF vulnerabilities.
2. **Conduct Regular Code Reviews:** Perform regular code reviews to identify and address potential CSRF vulnerabilities.

**Risk Statement:**

The use of HTTP basic or digest authentication over an unsecured connection poses a medium-risk vulnerability to the organization. If exploited, this vulnerability could allow unauthorized access to sensitive information, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of our systems and data. This could lead to financial losses, reputational damage, and potential non-compliance with regulatory requirements. The affected systems, data, and users include all users accessing the application via the `http://testapp.local:3000/api/login` endpoint.

**Compliance Mapping:**

* NIST CSF: PR.DS-5 (Protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information)
* ISO 27001: A.8.5 (Secure authentication), A.7.4 (Physical security monitoring), A.8.21 (Security of network services), A.8.1 (User endpoint devices), A.7.14 (Secure disposal or re-use of equipment)
* CWE: CWE-287 (Improper Authentication)
* OWASP: A04:2017 - Insecure Authentication

**Policy Requirements:**

To mitigate this vulnerability, the following security controls must be implemented:

1. **Technical Requirements:**
	* Protect the connection using HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or later) for all authentication requests.
	* Implement a stronger authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or JWT-based authentication.
2. **Procedural Requirements:**
	* Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and remediate similar vulnerabilities.
	* Develop and enforce a secure coding standard for all development teams.
3. **Success Criteria:**
